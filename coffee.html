    <h1>Pourover</h1>
    <p><p style="width: 450px;">
    One of the simplest ways to make coffee can also be the most difficult. The pourover
        requires the barista to manually control for many variables.
    The freshness, roast profile, size of the ground coffee, the temperature of the water, the rate of flow, the type of filter used,
and ratio of ground coffee to water, all factor into any brew method, but the pourover requires the barista to 
be aware of these variables, rather than rely on a machine to take the thinking out of the coffee creation process.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><p style=width: 450px;
    <ol>
<li>Bring at least 500 ml of water to a boil</li>
<li>Weigh 30 grams of whole bean coffee on your scale</li>
<li>Grind your whole bean coffee to a medium-fine grind size</li>
<li>Place your coffee filter into your pourover device, gently rinse the filter with water while keeping it in your pourover device.</li>
<li>Pour your ground coffee into the 'prewet' filter and pourover device. Gently shake the device to level the coffee bed.</li>
<li>With boiling water, slowly pour about 60 grams of water over the coffee bed. Be sure to soak the whole bed with no dry spots.</li>
<li>After about 30 seconds, begin slowly pouring about 100 grams of water over the coffee bed. This second pour should take about 45 seconds.</li>
<li>Pour another 100 grams or so just like before. Repeat this process until you have 500 grams of brewed coffee. This should take about 3 minutes.</li>
