    If you don't want to think <em>too much</em> about your coffee maker, the french press is for you. You only need a french press, some boiling water, and maybe a spoon if you want to get fancy.
    The coffee made in a french press has more body since it is not filtered with a paper filter. Some people prefer this while others may enjoy a "cleaner" cup of coffee.
